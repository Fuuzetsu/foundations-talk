  \frametitle{Quick overview}
  Originally this talk was going to be about dependent types.\\
  \pause
  It turned out that I was running out of time before even getting
  into regular typing.\\
  \pause
  Changed the topic to something that builds upon knowledge you most
  likely already have: imperative programming.\\
  \pause
  This talk is going to essentially be a cut-down, partial, 10-minute
  version of the excellent presentation given by Brian Beckman titled
  ``Don't fear the Monad''.\\
  \pause
  Go watch it, it's awesome.
